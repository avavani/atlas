Statistically speaking, Nepal is a poor country. It ranks 180/222 in terms of GDP per capita [1](https://www.cia.gov/the-world-factbook/field/real-gdp-per-capita/country-comparison/), ranking well behind other post-conflict nations of Kosovo(132) and Laos (153). 23.8% of the adult population are illiterate and [2](https://censusnepal.cbs.gov.np/results/literacy) and 41.9% of households sleep under roofs of galvanized tin sheets [3](https://censusnepal.cbs.gov.np/results/household).

However, such reality seems extremely far away in the capital city of Kathmandu where Teslas frequent the roads. Kathmandu's prosperity isn't new and stems from a list of historic and geographic factors. Situated at 4.6K ft above sea level, the Kathmandu valley is a large swath of fertile flatland in the mountainous Himalayan Range[4](https://www.fao.org/4/t0706e/T0706E01.htm). Due to this geographic advantange, the region has been continously settled for at least 2000 years [5](https://www.nepalhikingteam.com/origin-of-kathmandu-valley). The large settlements attracted more people and soon Kathmandu found itself as an important trading hub, linking the India-Tibet land route [6](https://www.asiasocietymuseum.com/buddhist_trade/himalaya_nepal.html). Kings built roads, waterworks, and schools; merchants traded gold, spices and silk; while pilgrims spread art, region and philosophy. Consequentialy, Kathmandu and its residents grew rich while its surrounding countryside languished into subsistence farming.

We can see Kathmandu's regional dominance displayed clearly in its 2021 Census data[7](https://censusnepal.cbs.gov.np/results/downloads/ward?type=data). A comprehensive decinnial survey, the 2021 census is the most recent and most representative data on Nepal's socioeconomic factors. Key metrics such as number of households and their associated wealth quintile is present at the municipal ward level in excel format. While the data is not spatial, it is possible to use data cleaning methods to convert them. This report hence marks the first spatial exploration of the Nepal census data.
