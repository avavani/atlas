### For more than a century, the **Democratic Republic of Congo** has been **foundational** in the development of modern technologies. 

**Rubber** for car tires, **copper** for electrical wiring, and even the **uranium** used in the Manhattan Project—all of them came from the mines of the **Democratic Republic of Congo**. Yet, very little of material benefit from these resources has ever trickled down to its people. 

Today, the DRC is the supplier of another key natural resource—**cobalt**, which is essential in all **battery-powered electronics**. **70% of cobalt** used in all global **Electric Vehicles**, **Smartphones**, **Laptops**, and more come from the DRC, mined by men, women, and children in extremely hazardous conditions[1](https://www.cfr.org/blog/why-cobalt-mining-drc-needs-urgent-attention).
