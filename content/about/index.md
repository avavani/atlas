# Hi, I'm Avani 👋

![Avani](avani.jpeg)

I'm a technologist passionate about leveraging spatial data to address our most pressing challenges. The individual person thinks in terms of space. Spatial data hence can help uncover unique insights on consumer behaviour, public health, supply chains, and labour markets through a people-first lens. 

This is my personal website where I document my own learnings about our world. I am very grateful to all that are taking their time to view my work—please feel free to direct any feedback, suggestions, or thoughts to my [email](mailto:avaniadhikari@hotmail.com). 

Some other quick facts about me:

- 🌏 I've been around the world a bit. Growing up, I moved between 6 countries and changed 7 schools before college.
- 👩‍💻 I am an Urban Econonmist by training. I have a **Bachelor's in Economics** from Yale-NUS College and a **Master's in Urban Planning** from the University of Pennsylvania.
- 🗞️ I was a former aspiring journalist, but I contributed to and was the editor-in-chief of Yale-NUS's student newspaper, **The Octant** .
